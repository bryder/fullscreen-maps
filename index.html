<h1>Add the missing fullscreen button</h1>

<p>
  On some sites that features maps there is no possibility to expand the map from a small box to fill the entire screen.
  These bookmarklets and user scripts will add the missing button to make that possible.
</p>

<p>
    There are two alternative ways to use these, as bookmarklets that can be selected each time you visit a maps page and want to add a fullscreen button or as
    user scripts that will run automatically every time you visit a maps page.
</p>

<h2>Available for these sites:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="garmin-connect/">Garmin Connect</a></li>
  <li><a href="eniro/">Eniro</a></li>
</ul>
